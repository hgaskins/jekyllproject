              <br/>
                <p>This is a Blog Page creation exercise for me. I have used the Jekyll static site generator along with Github Pages to get a Blog up and running for free. To learn more about me you can visit my personal site here <a href="http://hannahgaskins.com"> check it out!</a> Jekyll is an open source platform which I learned how to use via Treehouse and other tutorial resoures on the internet. Apparently you can learn how to do anything in that crazy internet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
                <p>Landing-Page includes full HTML, CSS, and custom JavaScript files along with LESS files for easy customization.</p>
